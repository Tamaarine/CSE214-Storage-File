Garret picked up his board and turned to me, waiting. And for about the
hundredth time this afternoon, my stomach gave a weird little jolt. His hair
shone in the sun, and his sculpted arms and shoulders were highly noticeable
without his shirt. As was the lean, tanned, washboard stomach and chest. The
boy definitely worked out or did something strenuous in his free time. One
did not get a body like that from sitting around.
And even though he denied it, I couldn’t help but think he had done this
before. He was so graceful, knowing exactly where to put his feet, how to
balance himself on the board. Even on land, with the board stationary, I could
tell he would do fine in the water, maybe more than fine.
Maybe I was wrong. Maybe he would wipe out, as I had on my first day of
surf lessons. Granted, I wasn’t going to let him try the monsters just yet, but
one did not just pick up a board and surf merrily down a wave on the very
first try.
“Come on,” I told him, grabbing my board. “I’ve shown you everything
you need. Now you just have to do it.”
He followed us into the water without hesitation, paddling about a hundred
yards from shore. As always, while floating on my board in the middle of the
sparkling ocean, I felt a familiar rising excitement. Maybe I couldn’t fly
anymore, but this—the rush, the prickle of danger, the adrenaline—certainly
came close. At least I didn’t have to give this up just yet.
I remembered Cobalt, soaring with him over the crashing ocean, racing the
waves, and felt a twinge of sadness and regret. I’d never do that again. Which
meant I’d probably never see him again, either.
“Ember?” Garret’s voice broke through my melancholy. He sat very close,
bobbing on the surface of the water, and his metallic gaze was fastened on
me. “You all right?”
That same prickle again, but I ignored it. “Yeah,” I said, giving him a bright
smile. “I’m fine. Just…looking for waves.”
“That’s a relief.” He actually smiled back. “Because I’m depending on you
to show me how to do this. The lesson isn’t over yet, I hope.”
Those eyes. I felt like they pierced right through me; that if I didn’t break
away now, they would peel me open to see what lay beneath. Deep within, the
dragon stirred, growling. She didn’t like this human, I realized. Maybe he
scared her, or the intensity of his gaze reminded her of a predator. Or maybe
she felt that, if I stared at him much longer, I would lose myself in those
stormy eyes and forget all about a certain golden-eyed rogue, waiting for me
in the darkness.
“Here comes a good one!” Lexi announced.
I tore my gaze away and stared out over the water. Coming right at us,
getting larger as it approached, was the familiar swell of our next ride. And,
by the looks of it, it wasn’t a small one. Not gigantic, per se, but definitely not
the “baby” wave I’d promised Garret.
Oops. So much for easing him into it.
I jerked my board around as Lexi did the same, and Garret followed our
example. “When I say go,” I told him, lying flat on my stomach, “paddle just
like I told you. Paddle like your life depends on it, and don’t look back.”
Briefly, our gazes met. I didn’t see any fear or doubt on his face, just
confidence, excitement and trust. My breath caught under that look, but then
the swell loomed over us, and I hollered for everyone to go.
We paddled. I hit the top of the wave first, and for just a moment, I perched
on the rim of a mountain, my board teetering on the edge. Then the nose of
the board plunged downward, and I leaped upright as we began to fall.
Wind and spray whipped around me, buffeting my hair. I didn’t see
anything but the ocean and the front of my board as it sliced through the
water.
And then, Garret sliced past me, his board sending up a spray of foam.
Startled, I nearly fell, but quickly regained my balance and watched him from
the corner of my eye. He stood on the board just as I’d taught him, knees bent,
arms slightly raised, the wind whipping at his hair as he careened down the
wave. A thrill of pride zipped through me, and I steered my board in his
direction, pulling alongside him.
“You’re doing it!” I called, though my voice was probably drowned out by
the roar of the wave behind us. But then Garret looked over with a brief,
dazzling smile, and my heart nearly stopped. I’d never seen him smile before,
not a real one, and it transformed him completely. He was a creature of light,
of energy and power and adrenaline, and absolutely beautiful.
Behind us, the wave curled over and crashed in a roar of foam and spray,
losing fury as it petered out in the shallows. Still on our boards, we cruised
toward the beach until our momentum gave out and Garret hopped off the
board into waist-deep water. He was panting, breathing hard, his whole face
lit up again with an eager, excited grin as he spun to me.
“That was amazing,” he exclaimed as I grinned back and splashed beside
him, our boards bumping noses as they floated behind us. “I never felt… I
mean…” He shook his head, sending droplets flying from his wet hair.
“Just… Wow.”
I laughed. It was good to see him like this, unguarded and free. He was
normally so reserved, I had wondered if he’d ever had any real fun in his
entire life. “Beginner’s luck, I think. No more going easy on you—next time
we’ll catch a real ride.”
“Hey, guys!” Lexi floated over, straddling her board. “What’s the holdup?
Are we going again, or what?”
I looked at Garret. He grinned, looking eager and boyish as he grabbed his
board and turned toward the waves. “Yeah. Let’s go again.”
Birth of a new surfer, I thought smugly, following them into the water. Let’s
hope I haven’t created a monster.
* * *
We surfed the rest of the afternoon. Garret was an incredibly quick study,
learning to spot approaching waves, eventually passing on those that were too
small. He did wipe out a couple times, but we all did, and he fell off his board
much less than I expected, especially on the bigger waves. Even after a
particularly nasty wipeout, he bounced to his feet, shook water from his hair
and waded dauntlessly back into the surf.
The sun was hanging low and red over the water when we finally stopped,
Calvin returning from farther down the alcove to join us. I was starving, tired
and a little sore from being tumbled through the surf a few times, but Garret
seemed reluctant to head back. He was insatiable. I really had created a
monster.
“Can we do this again?” he asked, quite seriously, as we loaded the boards
onto the roof of the car. I looked at him, at the way his eyes stayed trained on
me, the calm, happy look on his face, and my stomach danced.
“Sure!” I grinned and tugged down a strap. “When did you have in mind?”
“Tomorrow,” was the immediate reply. “If that’s okay with you.”
I would’ve liked nothing better than to meet him again, maybe alone this
time, but unfortunately… “I can’t tomorrow, Garret,” I said. “It’s Kristin’s
birthday, and we’re meeting at the mall that afternoon so we can watch her
buy things, I mean…so we can hang out and stuff. Sorry.” At least, I hoped
I’d be able to make it. Scary Talon Lady had really screwed up my mornings,
so the important things like surfing and hanging out with friends had to be
moved to the afternoon. Thankfully, neither Kristin nor Lexi were early risers.
“Come with us!” piped Lexi from the other side, poking her head over the
roof. “Kristin won’t mind, and I think she’s bringing someone, so you won’t
be the only guy there. Sadly, my deadbeat brother won’t be joining us.”
Calvin didn’t even look up from his surfboard. “Walk around the mall with
a bunch of girls squealing at clothes and other dudes? Yeah, you have fun
with that.”
I ignored him, focused on Garret. “Anyway, that’s where we’ll be
tomorrow afternoon. You’re welcome to come along.”
“To the mall?” A faintly troubled look crossed his face, that wariness
settling back on him like a second skin. “I…don’t know. Maybe.”
“Well,” I said, trying to sound nonchalant, “if you make up your mind,
you’re welcome to join us. If it’s lunchtime, just look for me at the Panda
Garden in the food court, or at the Cinnabon next door.”
“If it’s before lunch, just follow the sounds of Ember complaining that
she’s hungry,” Lexi added, and dodged the pebble I hurled at her.
It hit Calvin instead, earning a very exasperated, “Dude!” and the order to
get in the car before he tied us to the roof with the surfboards. I obeyed, a
little sad that such an awesome day had come to an end, but the genuine smile
Garret gave me as we slid into the back made it all worth it.
Back at the Smoothie Hut, we pulled into the spot next to Garret’s black
Jeep, and I gazed mournfully at our gorgeous tagalong. “Well.” I sighed as
Lexi exited the front and pushed her seat forward to let him out. “See you
around, I guess. If not tomorrow, then…some other time.” I perked as I
remembered something, leaning forward as he left the car. “Hey, don’t forget,
Kristin’s party is this Saturday. Maybe we’ll see you then?”
“Maybe.” He paused and turned back to me, gray eyes intense. “Thank you
for today,” he said softly. “I had…fun.” Like the word was strange to him. I
smiled, feeling a warm glow spread through me from within, even as my
dragon hissed in disgust.
“Anytime,” I replied, and he was gone.
A few minutes later, I sat in the same corner booth from that afternoon,
plowing my way through a jumbo chili-cheese Coney dog, while Lexi slurped
her drink and gave me knowing looks across the table. I pretended to ignore
her until Calvin got up to stand in line for a second hamburger, and she leaned
in, grinning fiercely.
“You are so into him!”
“What?” I nearly choked on my Coney dog as I pulled back to glare at her.
Lexi gave me a smug look, and I shook my head. “You mean Garret? You’re
psychotic. I don’t know what you’re talking about.”
“You’re such a bad liar, Em.” She rolled her eyes and gestured to the nowempty parking spot where Garret’s Jeep had sat minutes before. “Admit it.
Whenever he looked at you, you couldn’t stop smiling. And when he rode that
first wave with you?” She raised her thin eyebrows. “You were about ready to
jump him.”
“You’re crazy,” I said. Because it wasn’t true. It couldn’t be. I was a
dragon. I couldn’t be attracted to a human. A gorgeous, athletic, gifted human,
but a human nonetheless. It was impossible. As a race, we appreciated beauty
and talent, grace and intelligence, but we did not form emotional attachments,
especially with human beings. That was something Talon made abundantly
clear: even among our own, dragons did not fall in love.
Lexi snorted, clearly unconvinced. “Whatever. Be the queen of denial, if
you want. But I think you know it’s the truth. And you know what?” She
leaned across the table again, like she was divulging the world’s greatest
secret. “I think he likes you, too.”
